The program consists of two microservices (Each one has a designated README.md):
- api (backend)
- client (frontend)


# Future Improvements

- Session Management: will allow each user to view only its history using a designated DB (for example,
  MongoDB) to store each user's data and metadata. (Initial implementation of cookies for auth exists)
- Improved prompt injection detection: Some queries which include prompt injection are not detected by llm-guard,
  or using Hugging Face models. 
- Allow the user conversation with the bot rather than a one-shot message.
